# Usagi - Manga Recommendations using AI
> Developed by **Joshua James**

### Overview

As a serial manga enjoyer, I sometimes (read: often) realize that I have no more manga to read. Sure, there are some recommendations I can see online and from my friends, but they really are sometimes (read: often) either bad or famous enough for me to know beforehand. To give me the experience of "never running out of manga to read", I had a random idea in mind which results in this repository.

### Demo

I think the design is intuitive enough (hopefully). Just enter the title of the manga (English or Japanese Romanization) and you'll (hopefully) get what you want.

I like Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin. 

### Tech stack

Overall, I enjoyed the experience of using the MERN stack. 
- Front-end: [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Back-end: [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

### How did you make the recommender?

Magic. A bit of python here and there, spam libraries also here and there. I used most of the stuffs I learnt from NTU's IE0005 anyways. I'd explain it further given the chance though but definitely not in this `README.md`. The notebook is also not included in this repository for obvious reasons (like this repository only contains the front-end part if you haven't noticed). 

### Can I access the API endpoints?
Sure. Just do some inspects and you should be good - I'm too lazy to add any security features anyways. However, if things happen to go south, I will do it. 

### Dataset

The dataset is scraped from MAL and Jikan API. The process takes around a few hours using Python's fetch API. Here's the [The compiled and cleaned dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joshjms/kawaii). You can create a Kaggle notebook using that dataset.

### Can **you** recommend me manga?

Sure, just contact me on Discord or anywhere you may find me. I'll be glad to help.
